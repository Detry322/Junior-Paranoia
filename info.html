					Paranoia. You know the basics. Run around like an idiot with a nerf gun. Stalk your friends, or even maybe that girl in your Spanish class. Then fill them with (hot?) foam. Paranoia is a game that is a classic at New Trier, involving teamwork, amongst other skills. The game as you probably know, is played for money, each team contributing money, and each having the chance to win big. This year, the Commissioner and his team have optimized and digitized the kill process for Paranoia, allowing for easier and less controversial kill reporting. All kills must be reported through the web site, and I recommend you talk to your parents and tell them you're playing this, and to expect possible home invaders. No, seriously, I'm pretty sure that's a rule. On the subject of the rules, you should follow them. They're important. Like really important. If you don't follow them, you may be kicked out, with no chance of winning the prize. Also, please to try be polite and considerate to your opponents, and the people around them. Just because you need the kill doesn't mean you should break the window and climb in. Use common sense, and I wish everyone good luck.

					If you're here, congratulations, you've truly reached an interestingly dark corner of the web. This is the official site for New Trier Junior Paranoia, an annual activity organized by several members of the Junior class for enjoyment and which involves, to put it bluntly, teenagers creeping around the North Shore with toy guns try to shoot each other at all times. As ridiculous, and possibly criminal as it sounds, there's a method to the madness, and rules keep things from becoming too crazy. I would highly recommend that if you have reservations about your son or daughter participating, you look around and read <a href="rules.html">the rules</a>, and perhaps <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-12-30/news/ct-met-new-trier-paranoia-20101230_1_toy-guns-nerf-streets">this newspaper article</a>, to gain a better understanding of our little game. This is really a great experience that many New Trier students look forward to every year. As a final word, I would advise you to keep a positive demeanor and remain understanding if a person on a team that is facing your child breaks into your residence. Fortunately, this is a fairly uncommon occurrence, and it is a game, so none of them, I would hope, have no intention of causing any physical harm or property damage. However, if you do feel threatened by the unconsented intrusion of a Paranoia player into your house, have no qualms in calling the police, after all, you are the homeowner, and anyone playing Paranoia who unlawfully enters your residence does so knowing fully the potential consequences. Hopefully that didn't scare anyone too much. Enjoy the site.
